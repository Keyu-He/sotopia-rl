# sotopia-rl

## Install

Create a conda environment with python 3.10
```
conda create -n sotopia-rl python=3.10
conda activate sotopia-rl
```

Then install poetry and use it to install the dependencies. Currently the package is under development so it's recommended to use the `--no-root` flag to avoid installing the package itself.
```
pip install poetry
poetry install --no-root
```
